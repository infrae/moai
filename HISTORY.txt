MOAI Changes
============

MOAI 1.1.0 (2010-04-08)
-----------------------

Changes
~~~~~~~

- Added new config option `deleted_sets` which can be used to make all 
  resources within a specific set `oai deleted` within the context of a 
  specific feed. In many cases this is preferable compared to `disallowed_sets`
  since resources will just dissapear when they are not allowed without
  leaving a proper deleted resource behind.
- Disable ranged HTTP requests in Apache mod_python backend. This was giving
  problems with acrobat plugin and its "Fast Web View" feature.
- Show records sorted on descending datestamp, instead of ascending record id,
  in sqlite backend.

Changes

MOAI 1.0.10 (2010-03-25)
------------------------

Changes
~~~~~~~

- Changed DIP:objectType to rdf:type in the didl metadata format, 
  as required by darenet/driver/didl 3.0 format
- Added support for modification dates and accessrights in the didl format
 

MOAI 1.0.9 (2010-02-16)
-----------------------

Changes
~~~~~~~

- Added checking on XML compatibility in update.py, update_database_iterate().
  This prevents the OAI server from crashing on invalid data. 
- Fixed a minor bug in tools.py. The -d (debug) flag for the update_database 
  script didn't halt on errors.

- Added a flush_threshold attribute to the DatabaseUpdater. This can be
  used to make the database flush after n records. By default the value
  is -1, and flushing only happens at the end of the update.
- Fixed assertion statements in content.py (gave warnings in python2.6)


MOAI 1.0.8 (2009-16-18) 
-----------------------

Changes
~~~~~~~

-----------------------

Changes
~~~~~~~

MOAI 1.0.6 (2009-08-12)
-----------------------

Changes
~~~~~~~

  further processing of the object. The object will be logged as 
  `ignored`
